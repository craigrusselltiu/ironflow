# IronFlow - Gym Routine Builder

Plan your weekly workout routine with an interactive drag-and-drop interface and see your muscle coverage at a glance.

## How to Use

### Building Your Routine

1. **Browse the Exercise Library** - Choose from 40+ exercises organized by muscle group
2. **Drag exercises into your week** - Drop them into any day (Monday through Sunday)
3. **Organize your schedule** - Reorder exercises within a day or move them between days
4. **Remove exercises** - Click the delete button on any exercise to remove it

### Understanding the Muscle Map

The ASCII body visualization shows which muscles you're training throughout the week:

- **Gray** - Not targeted
- **Green** - Lightly trained
- **Yellow/Orange** - Moderately trained
- **Red** - Heavily trained

Both front and back views are displayed so you can ensure balanced muscle coverage.

### Muscle Fatigue System

Each exercise contributes to muscle fatigue:
- **Primary muscles** receive more stimulus
- **Secondary muscles** receive supporting stimulus

This helps you identify:
- Overworked muscle groups (too much red)
- Neglected areas (gray zones)
- Whether you have adequate recovery between sessions

### Saving Your Routine

Your routine is automatically saved to your browser's local storage. When you return to the app, your workout plan will be right where you left it.
